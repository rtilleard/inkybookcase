# inkybookcase
Simple MVP for using Raspberry Pi and Inky to make a screen to show your books.

At the moment, it just kicks off a cycle of images which I downloaded onto the Pi. However, for next step I plan to investigate how to use an API to make this more automated.

The code is simple and generic - not doing much extra here! But sharing in case of interest.
